Review of: Report 1 by Sean Carter et al.
Reviewer: Apurva Raman

Overall, the report was interesting and an enjoyable read, although pretty heavily reliant on the assumption that the reader had read the article from The Economist.

The motivation for report and analysis was to replicate the results given by the article from The Economist using the Florida Prison Database from the Florida Department of corrections. I think the motivating question would be something along the lines of "how variable are these conclusions with different analysis methods" or "how much more or less likely is a guess that a prisoner committed murder (or other crime) correct given you know what tattoo that prisoner has" (I tried to address the implied relative frequency question brought up in your results section without suggesting a causal link, and it's hard to phrase this right).

The authors categorized the data into broader tattoo categories and crime categories and counted frequencies and compared the frequencies to the mean. The analysis did allow for comparison between the results from The Economist and indicated the size of the likelihood difference for different crimes.

The report balances clarity and engagement quite well, but it might be useful to state the conclusions made by The Economist at the beginning rather than relying on the assumption that the reader followed the link and read the article.

Overall, there is a good level of professionalism, but using descriptive section headings (or at least the whole word for Question, Methodology, Results, and Interpretation) would help a great deal.

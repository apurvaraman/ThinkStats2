## Report 2 Feedback for Willem Thorbecke

Apurva Raman

The primary motivating question of this report is to find out if there is any relationship between drug usage and depression. It uses the NSDUH. The authors did a regression analysis of different drugs with depression along with other demographic factors.

The tone of the report is a bit on the formal side, but is still engaging. Perhaps adding a few more lines framing the topic might help draw the reader in. In the methodology section, it might be useful to explain how you might expect the results to be different by not counting self-diagnosis. 
I don't think referring to things by their variable names makes as much sense as talking about what those variables mean (why bother mentioning AGE, SEX, and INCOME by variable name but not race?). You could explain the factors you chose to explore and then indicate what variables they correspond to in the data set and how to interpret the different values. 

Also, rather than just saying the pseudo R-squared value is lower, you could mention the value and then explain what that means. In general, more interpretation would help me understand the data better, especially in the analysis section where you talk about effect sizes and r-squared values. 

What I was really missing was some representation of the distribution or some basic exploration and summary statistics beforehand. I would at least like to see a scatterplot or something showing the relationship between the data so I can make some sense of the regression model. That would also help me understand why you didn't try a quadratic term or something along those lines.

In terms of how you displayed the regression results, making a table with just the important information (omitting things like date and time) might be nice, just so it's clear what data is relevant. You could also highlight the important values.

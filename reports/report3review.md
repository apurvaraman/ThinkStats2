## Report 3 Review
#### Written by Apurva Raman
#### Review of report by Kevin Zhang

The goal of the report seemed to be to identify groupings of foods based on macronutrients and biological characteristics and compare those groupings with the widely-used, but oft-criticized food pyramid. The authors used data from the United Kingdom nutrient databank and performed K-Means clustering on the dataset to identify how well the food groups corresponded to clusters in the data. The parameter for number of clusters chosen was 6 to be able to compare the clusters with one of the six food pyramid groups. 

I was unsure why the clustering was not just determined based on where natural clusters fell, and might have liked to see what all the foods looked like when they were graphed to see the clustering. This might be a messy plot, but you could link to an interactive cell in the notebook. 

I initially interpreted the clustering process as finding clusters in the data by some arbitrary separator, and checking if those clusters matched up with the categories in the food pyramid, but later it seemed like predicting for the categories in the food pyramid was the goal, and then what was being analyzed was how well clustered the data points were for foods in a certain category of the food pyramid.  The graphs and process seem to suggest the first approach, but the written text in the beginning was a little misleading, causing me to be confused about the analysis you did. Clarifying the approach earlier on would be more helpful. 

You did clearly address the question of whether the food pyramid groupings matched the clusters food falls into, but it might have been nice to name or list the clusters you did find. 

In terms of clarity, I thought as the report went along it got clearer. I had to read over the beginning sections a few times to understand them. 

The confusion matrix is explained well, impactful, and works really well to communicate the information about how well the food group works as a predictor. 

I really liked the limitations analysis and steps to take the project further sections- they were really clear and easy to read. 

Small formatting things: the figure captions are a bit inconsistent in style; one is bold, another is italicized.
